This repository demonstrates a bug and its solution related to using custom resolutions with the Expo Camera API. The bug manifests as an unclear error, potentially leading to a blank camera preview or app crashes. The solution provides a robust way to handle resolution selection and error conditions for a smoother user experience.  This is particularly useful for developers building camera-centric apps requiring specific aspect ratios or resolutions.
